# Goon App (not final name)

This is an app that currently does nothing, but has limitless potential.

## Plan

This section is where we keep more concrete ideas and plans, but it's subject to change at any time.

* Use Next.js for frontend
* Use Rust for backend?

## Ideas

This is where we can sketch out and brainstorm ideas that are not concrete. Feel free to delete bullet points below as we rule out ideas.

* An app to take over the world
* Virtual art fair app. A place for local artists to sell their art.
* An app to collect ratings and reviews on different brands of alcohol. For example, Josh Cabernet Sauvignon could have a consumer rating and reviews, then also have professional rating and reviews. Then it would show typical price. Vivino currently does that for wine, but ours could include beer, whiskey, bourbon, etc. as well.
* App to sell and buy pets (difficult to do so now)
* Bartering app for trading goods (like ebay or fb market place, but transactions are for trading items only, no money)
